# Electron Setup - Known Issues

## Current Status
- ✅ Dark mode theme provider and toggle added
- ✅ Electron dependencies installed (electron, electron-builder, etc.)
- ✅ Electron main process file created (electron/main.js)
- ✅ Electron preload script created (electron/preload.js)
- ✅ package.json configured for Electron builds
- ✅ Next.js config updated for standalone/export builds
- ❌ Electron runtime failing - `app` is undefined

## Issue Description
When running the Electron app, the following error occurs:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'whenReady')
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/briandawson/workspace/claude-config-mgr/electron/main.js:45:5)
```

The Electron module loads successfully, but `app` and `BrowserWindow` are undefined when destructured from `require('electron')`.

## Attempted Fixes
1. ✗ Using try-catch for detailed error logging
2. ✗ Creating launcher script (electron-start.js) to spawn Electron process
3. ✗ Reinstalling Electron package
4. ✗ Using various require patterns (destructuring vs separate vars)
5. ✗ Testing with npx, cross-env, and direct node execution

## Possible Causes
- Electron version incompatibility with Node.js v22.19.0
- Missing native module compilation
- Incorrect Electron binary path resolution
- Module resolution conflict between Next.js and Electron

## Next Steps to Try
1. Test with an older version of Electron (e.g., v27 or v26)
2. Check for native module compilation errors
3. Try simpler Electron setup without Next.js integration first
4. Consider using electron-next package for better integration
5. Test with different Node.js version (LTS v20)

## Files Created for Electron
- `electron/main.js` - Main Electron process
- `electron/preload.js` - Preload script for security
- `electron-start.js` - Launcher script for development
- Updated `package.json` with Electron scripts and build config
- Updated `next.config.js` for Electron compatibility

## Dark Mode Implementation (Working ✓)
- `components/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Theme context provider using next-themes
- `components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Toggle button component
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` with theme provider
- Added theme toggle to project dashboard header
- Full dark mode support with system theme detection
