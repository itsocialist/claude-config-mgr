# Quick Electron Test

Please run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/claude-config-mgr
./node_modules/.bin/electron test-official.js
```

This will test if Electron works with the official example code.

Let me know:
1. Does a window open?
2. What output do you see in terminal?
3. Any errors?
